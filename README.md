This is my Bachelor's Thesis, a Python script that can do basic Light Curve and Radial Velocity modelling using Least-Squares method. The graphical user interface (GUI) and the Radial Velocity method was added to the program after my graduation.

It should be noted that the manual for this project is not finished and the code can be much more optimized, as the structure of the GUI code can be improved significantly.

Currently working on a software for my Master's thesis which is similar to this project, but is statistically more accurate (uses MCMC and Bayesian Inference) and with the addition of Astrometry detection technique in preparation for the future Gaia Data Releases (currently a private repository).
