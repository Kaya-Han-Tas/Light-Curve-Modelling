This is my Bachelor's Thesis, a Python script that can do basic Light Curve and Radial Velocity modelling using Least-Squares method.

The manual for this project is not finished and the code can be much more optimized. 

Currently working on a software for my Master's thesis which is similar to this project, but is statistically more accurate and with the addition of Astrometry detection technique in preparation for the future Gaia Data Releases (currently a private repository).
